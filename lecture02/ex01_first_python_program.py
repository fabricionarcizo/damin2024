"""Introduction to Programming: Hello, Universe! Example"""

# Overview:
# This script introduces one of the most fundamental concepts in programming:
# writing a simple 'Hello, Universe!' program. This program is often the first
# code that beginners write when learning a new programming language.

# The 'Hello, Universe!' program serves as a basic example to familiarize
# yourself with the syntax of a programming language, the development
# environment, and the process of writing and executing code.

# Learning Objectives:
# By the end of this script, you will be able to:
# - Understand the purpose of the 'Hello, Universe!' program.
# - Write a simple 'Hello, Universe!' program in Python.
# - Execute the program and understand the output.
# - Recognize the basic structure of a Python program.

# What is a 'Hello, Universe!' Program?
# The 'Hello, Universe!' program is a simple program that outputs the text
# "Hello, Universe!" to the screen. It is often used to illustrate the basic
# syntax of a programming language and to ensure that a development environment
# is correctly set up.

# Why 'Hello, Universe!'?
# - Simplicity: The program is easy to understand and requires minimal code.
# - Fundamentals: It introduces essential concepts like outputting text to the
# console.
# - Validation: It confirms that the programming environment is working
# correctly.

# Writing Your First Python Program
# Let's write a "Hello, Universe!" program in Python.
# Python is a high-level programming language that is widely used for various
# types of software development.

# Step-by-Step Instructions:
# 1. Open your Python development environment (e.g., a text editor or an IDE).
# 2. Create a new Python script file, and name it `01_first_python_program.py`.
# 3. In the script, write the following code:

# This is the Python code to print "Hello, Universe!" to the console.
print("Hello, Universe!")

# Explanation of the Code:
# - `print()`: This is a built-in Python function that outputs text to the
# console.
# - `"Hello, Universe!"`: This is the string of text that will be displayed. In
# Python, strings are enclosed in quotation marks.

# When you run the script, Python executes the code and prints the text "Hello,
# Universe!" to the console.

# Executing the Program:
# To run the script, open your command line or terminal, navigate to the
# directory where you saved `01_first_python_program.py`, and type:
# python 01_first_python_program.py
# You should see the output "Hello, Universe!" printed on the screen.

# Conclusion:
# Congratulations! You've just written and executed your first Python program.
# This simple exercise is a significant first step in your programming journey.
# Understanding the basics, like how to print text to the screen, will form the
# foundation for more complex programming concepts you'll learn later.
